#CNN CMS with CSS!
And also with Ruby on Rails, but who doesn't love acronyms that start with C?

#What?
This is an article-generator created as a content management system for Model United Nations Conference organizers to spoof CNN articles. It is definitely a niche product but creating fake news articles is very important in MUN committees for delegates to get press releases. It will be used at TechMUN (Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology's Model United Nations Conference). 

#CNN?
Like the news source. 

#CMS?
Content management system: the users of the app (like the committee chairs or crisis staff) can manage the articles without having to touch anything tech-related. They just type their content into a form and this app will take care of the rest. 

#CSS?
Custom style sheets: basically makes it look like CNN articles. Not really relevant to the title but (as I mentioned earlier) who doesn't love acronyms that start with C?

#How it's made
This is a Ruby on Rails application (my first, in fact!) that was deployed using Heroku (thus the ugly domain name).
